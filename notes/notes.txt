  Your life is currency
Currency: Electricity

This is a game where you fight against radioactive worms for control of
thunder valley by using disco balls to direct robots.

eventually it starts raining worms

radioactive worm storm?

TODO
  enemy spawning schedule
    from both sides
  ditch storm center idea, it's dumb
    lightning should strike all rods every so often

  pop farthest first when de-assigning minions

  enemy dropship?
  parallax clouds
  parallax lights
  parallax mountains
  parallax hills
  parallax forests
  wasted lightning strike vs captured strike particle effects
DONE
  minions wander while at disco



Base
  You are a robot factory
  base survives on electricity; out of electricity -> lose
  Enemies that get to the base sap electricity
    more electriticy than if they destroy a minion?

Minions
  spend life power to create minions
  get stationed on lightning rods
  commanded via stationing points
  minions have their own batteries?
  flying minions?

stationing points
  aka disco balls :D
  all minions are evenly divided among all stationing points
  cost resources?

Lightning rods
  source of life / currency / electricity
  assign minions to gain electricity when storm strikes
  probably a lot of these

Enemies
  wave based, slowly waves get stronger and stronger

How to get electricity?
  commit minions to lightning rods via stationing points

Storm
  moves back and forth across the world
  charges lightning rods that have minions assign

Towers?
  predetermined spots where towers can be built?
  towers give nearby minions a defensive advantage?
  towers have upkeep?
  other tower types (offensive, etc)?
  giant electricity walls?
  impenetrable barriers?

COSTS
  minion: 1
  worm makes it to base: 2
  worms and minions cancel out 1:1
  strike grants 3
    strike is worth 1.5 worms-to-base, or 3 worms-to-minions
    makes sense to ramp up worms per strike as difficulty increases over time
    especially since you can't harvest all strikes immediately
    maybe have worm spawns scale with total electricity harvested?
      this captures resources in reserve as well as sunk into minions
      also doesn't punish for staying small early
      100 electricity is win
      let's aim for 300 electricity total
        100 power in the bank, 200 minions
        game should last ~five minutes
        100 strikes
          over 300 seconds, one (harvested) strike every three seconds average
          11 rods on the map, at the end you'll probably have close to all of them
            10 rods << 3 seconds / harvested strike
              1 second / harvested strike
                10 rods -> 1 second / strike
                  1 strike / 10 rod-seconds
          at the beginning, probably quite few
            3 rods >> 3 seconds / harvested strike
              3 rods -> 3 seconds / strike
        ~175 worms
          over 300 seconds is 0.58 worms / second
            1.7 seconds between worms average


Competence / Mastery | Moment-to-Moment Efficacy
  directing minions efficiently
    choosing when to advance
  constantly scanning back and forth to see incoming threats / opportunities
  maybe there are power checkpoints where big swarms spawn
Competence / Mastery | Long Term Growth
  expansion of territory
    need something to deter expansion
    losing a tower should be very costly
      permanently destroyed?
      spawns huge swarm?
Competence / Mastery | Sustained Competence Feedback
  electricity level
  lots of minions
    why is lots of minions good?
